# Visual-Weather

A website that portrays the weather forecast using only visuals

Utilizing the user's location and openweather API, the site provides weather forecast for the user's current location or, to the registered user, a list of set places.

After achieving this initial goal, I grew interested in communicating the weather condition outside graphically, without the use of numbers and as little text as possible. 

Although the styling isn't finished, a working version of the site can be found here:
