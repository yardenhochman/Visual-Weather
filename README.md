# Visual-Weather

A website that portrays the weather forecast using only visuals

This project's original focus was utilizing the user's location and openweather API to provide weather forecast. After achieving this initial goal, I grew interested in communicating the weather condition outside graphically, without the use of numbers and as little text as possible.
